## Inspiration

**Micro-influencers**

Part-time social influencers who usually focus on targeted niche market with moderate followers on twitter. They usually face a hard time finding sponsorship and featured products as normal social influencers reach out platform are potentially quite demanding as they must compete with top social influencers.

**Small and medium Business**

They are limited in terms of marketing budget and category-specific in terms of their product-lines. As a result, it demands more expenses and resources to find a social influencer of their spending rate and promote their campaign on twitter.
